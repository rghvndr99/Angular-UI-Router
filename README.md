## What is UI Route
ui-router is a 3rd-party module and is very powerful. It supports everything the normal ng-Route can do as well as many extra functions.

## Why UI Route

Angularjs provides its own module for routing named as 'ng-Route'.Then question arises why 'UI-Route'?Well. ng-Route provides routing but there are certain boundaries where it fails.
Like if user needs 'multiple named route' or 'nested route'.
